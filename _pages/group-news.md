• [2025.09] We sincerely thank the organizers of *Flatlands Beyond Graphene 2025* for their kind invitation. Prof. Yong Xie was invited to deliver a plenary talk and chaired the Tuesday evening Shotgun Session.  

• [2025.08] We were delighted to host Prof. Eduardo R. Hernández and Prof. Andres Castellanos-Gomez during this hot summer. They shared deep theoretical insights and practical guidance through lectures and lab discussions with our students.  

Special thanks to graduate students Qianjie Lei and Yang Liu for their dedicated support.  
Scientific inspiration often sprouts quietly during such conversations.
