## 2025

â€¢ [2025.09] Our manuscript was accepted by **APL Machine Learning** ðŸŽ‰ â€” first time receiving an acceptance notice over a weekend! Many thanks to **Yang Liu**, **Qianjie Lei**, **Xiaolong He**, and all teammates for the hard work. Although a fully *human-out-of-the-loop* autonomous lab is still ahead, we have validated in class that this teaching experiment design works very well.

â€¢ [2025.09] We thank the organizers of **Flatlands Beyond Graphene 2025**. Prof. Yong Xie delivered an **invited talk** and chaired the Tuesday evening **Shotgun Session** (Milan, Italy).<br>
