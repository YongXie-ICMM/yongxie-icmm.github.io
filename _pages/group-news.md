## 2026

- [2026.02] Our team **MateFin** won **1st place (tie)** in the **Web Agent** track of the **UC Berkeley AgentX-AgentBeats Phase 1** competition, among **1,300+ participating teams**. This is an important international recognition of our work on robust web-agent design, and it validates our direction in building practical, reliable AI agents for real-world tasks. [Official announcement](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/agentx-agentbeats.html).<br>

- [2026.02] Added a new learning resource for students and group members: [MISSING Semester 2026 (MIT CSAIL)](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2026/).

## 2025


- [2025.11] Our **Small Methods** paper has now been accepted and published online: [Low-Cost Maskless Photolithography Using an LCD-3D Printer for Microelectronic Devices](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smtd.202501336).

  In this work, we successfully used a €200 3D printer to perform semiconductor photolithography experiments and scaled the process to wafer level. This demonstrates that what limits us is not hardware, but imagination.

  Congratulations to **Qianqian Wu** (visiting PhD student from Jiangnan University) and **Ying Zhang** (PhD student in our group). This work is truly cool!<br>

• [2025.09] Our manuscript was accepted by **APL Machine Learning** 🎉 — first time receiving an acceptance notice over a weekend! Many thanks to **Yang Liu**, **Qianjie Lei**, **Xiaolong He**, and all teammates for the hard work. Although a fully *human-out-of-the-loop* autonomous lab is still ahead, we have validated in class that this teaching experiment design works very well. The paper is now available online: [Building an affordable self-driving lab: Practical machine learning experiments for physics education using Internet-of-Things](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046105/3369966).
