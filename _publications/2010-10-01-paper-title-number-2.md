Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted extensive interest because of their superior electrical, optical, thermodynamic, and mechanical properties, which hold great potential in the development of flexible paper-based devices. The family of vdW materials is significantly diverse, and their electronic features range from metallic to semiconducting and superconducting. This review covers the state-of-the-art research progress in the development of various vdW materials, from fabrication to applications in paper-based electronics and optoelectronics. In particular, the promising applications of vdW materials integrated with paper as flexible mechanical sensors, environmental sensors, and photodetectors are highlighted. The remaining challenges and prospects relat
