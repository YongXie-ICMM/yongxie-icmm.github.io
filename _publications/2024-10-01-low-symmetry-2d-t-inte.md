Polarization‐sensitive photodetection grounded on low‐symmetry 2D materials has great potential for intelligent sensing and multidimensional visual perception. Here, 2D t-InTe crystals are introduced to realize **UV–Vis–NIR broadband** response together with a **high anisotropy ratio** in polarized photodetection, benefiting from a narrow band gap and intrinsically low-symmetry lattice.
