The atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide (e.g., MoS$_2$) material can withstand large strains up to 11% to change its energy band structure, thereby further tuning its optical, electrical, and other physical properties. However, the slippage of 2D materials on the substrate hinders further strain tuning of their properties. Here, a facile three-point approach combined with a dry transfer method that applies uniaxial strain to two-dimensional materials is presented. The slippage of WSe$_2$ on a polycarbonate (PC) substrate can be suppressed by thermally annealing WSe$_2$/PC in low-pressure Ar atmosphere above 100 $^{\circ}$C for 3 hours. Straining cycle evolution experiments revealed that the thermal annealing of monolayer (1L) WSe$_2$ could suppress slippage from the surface of the PC. The spectral gauge factor of 1L WSe$_2$ is found to be around -60 meV/%. After thermal treatment, WSe$_2$/PC showed enhanced stability against slippage.
