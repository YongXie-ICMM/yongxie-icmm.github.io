Broad frequency tuning is an essential attribute desired in resonant nano/microelectromechanical systems (NEMS/MEMS) and their many applications. Endowed with ultrahigh intrinsic strain limits, combined with other unconventional properties, atomically thin 2D crystalline materials are excellent candidates for building highly tunable resonant NEMS. Here a heterogeneous integration approach is demonstrated to enable on-chip, continuous, and broad frequency tuning in 2D NEMS resonators by directly controlling strain via voltage-controlled silicon-on-insulator (SOI) comb-drive MEMS actuators. By varying the comb-drive actuation voltage, resonance frequency of the 2D NEMS can be tuned as large as 75% continuously with precise control. The comb-drive actuation-enabled direct straining and tuning also yield quality (Q) factor boost up to twofold.
