Single-layer MoS₂ produced by mechanical exfoliation is usually connected to thicker, multilayer regions. This paper demonstrates a facile laser trimming method to electrically isolate single-layer MoS₂ regions from thicker areas, enabling patterning of single-layer MoS₂ channels with regular geometry. Electrical characterization confirms the effective disconnection, while scanning photocurrent microscopy shows that, post-laser trimming, only the single-layer MoS₂ region contributes to photocurrent generation. This method provides a direct-write, lithography-free alternative to the reactive ion etching process, requiring no resist or wet chemicals to pattern MoS₂ flakes.
